# Proofable Trust Workflow

Reuse existing proofs first. Verify again only when needed. Summarize as **Proofable**: Passed, Action needed, or Blocked. Never dump raw tool JSON.

Use this before an assistant runs sensitive tools or takes another verification-sensitive step. Answer simple questions directly.

## When to use

- Before sensitive tools, spend, publish, secrets, or agent actions
- When the user asks for Proofable, proofs, Vault, or trusted-agent setup
- When acting as a registered profile agent in a project

## Workflow

1. **`proofable_context`** once per session. Prefer signed-in profile context; omit wallet fields on check/verify tools.
2. **Profile agent:** **`proofable_agent_mount`** (or `proofable mount <agentId> --apply <host>`) for identity, permissions, skills, and context.
3. **Trust before action:** **`proofable_proofs_check`** → **`proofable_verify_or_guide`**. `proofable_proofs_check` is eligibility-only; never use it for memory, context, or content retrieval. When signed in, ownership checks continue with **`proofable_verify`**. Share a browser link only when a tool returns one.
4. **Agent:** **`proofable_agent_link`**. If missing, **`proofable_agent_create`** (use `generate` for a dedicated key). Then **`proofable_agent_mount`**.
5. **Proofs and context:** use the `proofable_context` context index first, then **`proofable_proofs_get`** with a known proof ID and `include=content` for an exact body.
6. **Vault:** **`proofable_secret_list`** / **`proofable_secret_create`** / **`proofable_secret_revoke`**.
7. Reuse existing proofs via **`proofable_proofs_check`** before creating new ones. When signed in, `proofable_context` returns the current profile context; re-call it only after a profile change.
8. Summarize as **Proofable**.

## Proofable format

Use the Passed / Action needed / Blocked guidance from `proofable_context`. Never invent proof IDs, verifier IDs, or statuses.

```txt
Proofable: Passed. Requirement satisfied. Proof on file. Next: Continue.
Proofable: Action needed. Missing: <step>. Next: Complete the secure step, then retry.
Proofable: Blocked. A required trust condition was not satisfied. Next: Do not continue until it passes.
```

## Hard rules

- Proofs stay off the chain unless the user asks for a blockchain record. Do not prompt for a wallet otherwise.
- Use proof IDs only from tool responses. Prefer “proof ID” / “portable proof” in user text.
- Store secrets only via **`proofable_secret_create`**. Confirm stored name + proof ID. Never paste tokens into chat.
- Use live verifier IDs from **`proofable_context`** / **`proofable_verifiers_catalog`**. Do not hardcode a second catalog.
